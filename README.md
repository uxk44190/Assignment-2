Question 7:

This script trains Decision Tree classifiers on the Iris dataset with
different depths (1, 2, 3) to compare training vs. testing accuracy.
It demonstrates the biasâ€“variance trade-off:
- Very shallow trees (e.g., depth=1) may underfit and perform poorly.
- Deeper trees (e.g., depth=3) fit more patterns and improve train accuracy,
  but overly deep trees can overfit and hurt generalization.

Outputs:
- Train and test accuracy for each specified max_depth.
